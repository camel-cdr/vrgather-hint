== Introduction

The document proposes a new vrgather range HINT instruction, which allows hardware implementations to provide specialized implementations of in-lane shuffles.
This is needed to be competitive with other contemporary SIMD/Vector ISAs, which have dedicated in-lane shuffle instructions.

The proposed HINT closes this gap while maintaining backwards compatibility with the standard "V" extension, such that the HINT can be directly used in code targeting the base "V" extension.
Further, it provides a fully general solution that works for all lane sizes.

== Motivation and Rational

The RISC-V Vector extension provides the `vrgather.vv` and `vrgatherei16.vv` instructions for arbitrarily shuffling elements within vector registers.
While this type of instruction is very powerful and required for any modern SIMD/Vector ISA, there are a few challenges that complicate hardware implementations.

*vrgather fundamentally scales quadratically in complexity with element count*, so by extension VLEN and LMUL.
However, many vrgather shuffles don't require this full complexity, as they shuffle elements within power-of-two lanes of elements.

A fast and high throughput LMUL=1 vrgather implementation is non-negotiable for application class processors that expect to run general purpose code.
LMUL>1 vrgather is usually implemented by applying a LMUL=1 vrgather primitive LMUL^2 times.
This is fine because, if an application doesn't need to gather across LMUL=1 vector register boundaries, it can use multiple LMUL=1 vrgathers instead, which scales linearly and also reduces register pressure.

When increasing VLEN, a fast LMUL=1 vrgather implementation grows quadratically in area.
This is a cost application class processors must pay; however, this also increases instruction latency and potentially reduces the throughput affordable in design constraints.
*Ideally we'd want to add new vrgather instructions that specify a lane width and only shuffle within those lanes.*
This allows implementations to implement those vrgather variants with smaller lane sizes using a lower latency. Additionally, it is now possible to implement these on more execution units than was previously affordable if all execution units would have to implement the full vrgather.

AVX-512 and SVE2.1 have precedent for such instructions, specifically for shuffles within lanes of 128 bits.
Looking at the different AVX-512 implementations in <<avx512>>, we can see that the general shuffle `vpermb` indeed has a higher latency and lower throughput than the in-128-bit-lane shuffle `vpshufb`.

While it's possible to detect when a general shuffle is used with non-lane-crossing indices at runtime, this is non-trivial, especially for high-performance out-of-order application class processors, and more suited for long vector DLEN<VLEN architectures.
// this is more general, e.g. reverse, but only makes sense for DLEN<VLEN

The problem with adding new in-lane vrgather variants is that they would see little use, as it would take many years to see them in hardware, let alone in the base profile targeted by operating systems.
*Instead of new vrgather instructions, we can add new vrgather range HINT instructions, which are fully backwards compatible with the standard "V" extension.*

To understand how the proposed vrgather range HINT instructions allow you to write backwards compatible code with optimized in-lane shuffles, we have to consider two usescases:

1. SHUF: A general in-lane shuffle of elements.
2. LUT: A fixed-size lookup table that may be smaller than the vector length.

In the SHUF use case, the input vector elements are shuffled within fixed lanes.
This is done using the full indices, so it produces the correct results without the HINT.
The proposed vrgather range HINT now tells the hardware that it's allowed to only look at the lowest n-bits of the indices and apply the shuffle within the corresponding lanes.
<<shuf>> and <<shuf_hint>> visualize the behavior and show how the result is the same.

Compared to a dedicated in-lane vrgather instruction, the HINT allows for the same architectural optimizations. It may, however, require an additional instruction to set the ignored upper bits to correspond to the lane index for the case when the HINT is ignored.
Fortunately, the most common applications of such SHUF operations have constant shuffle indices (see <<survey>>), and if that's not the case, it's trivial to constrict set the bits appropriately.
Another small drawback of the HINT instruction is that for shuffles of 8-bit elements, you need to use 16-bit indices when VLEN>=2048. It's recommended to have two code paths, one for VLEN<2048 and one for VLEN>=2048 in such cases.
These small drawbacks seem worth it, considering the huge advantage of backward compatibility.
Additionally, both of these disadvantages don't apply to the LUT use case.

In the LUT use case, the index elements are used to index the first n elements of the input vector as a fixed lookup table.
Such operations are extremely common, especially in string processing, see <<survey>>.
Currently this is implemented by simply gathering from the first n elements, and this can stay the same with the HINT instruction.
The only difference is that you have to make sure to duplicate the lookup table to every input lane, as shown in <<lut>> and <<lut_hint>>.

To summarize, we propose a new vrgather range HINT instruction to allow implementations to easily provide specialized implementations of in-lane shuffles while maintaining backward compatibility with the standard "V" extension.
The HINT can be used in existing code running on existing processors, while a new vrgather instruction would take years to become available and then split the ecosystem.
Compared to new dedicated in-lane vrgather variants, the HINT provides the same efficiency for the previously described LUT use case and only requires one additional instruction when used for the SHUF use case with dynamic indices.

Description::
Provide a HINT to hardware that it is allowed to execute the immediately subsequent `vrgather.vv` or `vrgatherei16.vv` instruction by only considering the lowest N index bits and gathering from adjacent lanes.
E.g. for `vl=16` and `vp2rangei imm=3`, hardware is allowed to gather the first `8=1<<imm` destination elements vector from indices 0 to 7 of the source vector and destination elements 8 to 15 from the indices 8 to 15 of the source vector.

[NOTE]
====
It's the responsibility of software to meet the preconditions that ensure the behavior is the same when the HINT is ignored or handled by hardware.
Two common uses are a) the source lanes are all equivalent (e.g. lookup table) b) the indices only read from the corresponding lanes (in-lane shuffle).

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
// updated vrgather.vv/vrgatherei16.vv index computation
var idx = unsigned(vs1_val[i]);
if (range_hints_enabled && has_range_hint) {
    let mask = (1 << range_hint_imm) - 1;
    idx = (idx & mask) | (i & ~mask);
}

| simdjson        | 8   | 0             | 2 (implements `vcompress.vm`)

|===

<<cat>> shows the rarity of the dynamic SHUF use case, which requires an additional instruction with the proposed HINT compared to a dedicated in-lane shuffle.
The large amount of constant SHUF usage means we should separately also consider other instructions, like `vrgatherei4.vx` which stores 16 4-bit indices in a GPR.
